## 💬 Prompt

> “These are some sample on-board questionnaires that I came up with for our app. Based on this, can you create a longer set of questions? Also, I just randomly put it but it will be nice if you could categorize questions, for example: mental health, physical activity, social circle, self-esteem etc. These are just example categories so if you could think of better ones to assess social wellness in various aspects, please suggest me accordingly!”

**AI Response Summary:**  
GPT-5 proposed a six-category framework that captures social wellness comprehensively but in a non-clinical, youth-friendly tone.

#### 🧩 **Six Core Categories**

1. **Social Connection & Interaction** — Frequency and quality of in-person socializing.
2. **Emotional Confidence & Self-Esteem** — Self-perception in social and emotional contexts.
3. **Active Lifestyle & Participation** — Involvement in group or outdoor activities.
4. **Digital Lifestyle & Dependency** — Balance between online and offline socialization.
5. **Stress Coping & Emotional Sharing** — Willingness to communicate when under stress.
6. **Purpose & Community Engagement** — Motivation to participate in collective or altruistic causes.

Each category contained 3–5 multiple-choice questions with simple 4-point Likert answers. GPT-5 also suggested maintaining **short, conversational question phrasing** (“I tend to overthink how others perceive me”) and **emotionally neutral wording** to avoid judgment bias.

## Project Evolution

### 🪐 **Stage 1 — Initial State**

The first version of the questionnaire (pre-AI) was a simple static form with a few general lifestyle and emotional questions.  
It lacked visual identity, question hierarchy, and connection to AImee’s core theme of _social wellness gamification_.

### 🌙 **Stage 2 — After AI Integration**

After GPT-5’s guidance, the team implemented:

- A **6-dimension social wellness structure** based on behavioral psychology and digital wellbeing models.
- Refined Likert-scale phrasing with consistent answer progression (“Never → Sometimes → Often → Always”).
- Thematic labels for each category (e.g., _Emotional Status_, _Social Connection_, _Digital Lifestyle_).
- Personalized feedback logic: users’ answers feed into a “Social Wellness Index” determining their initial level (Cosmic Dust → Galaxy).

### 🌌 **Stage 3 — Visual Implementation**

Following the AI framework, the team designed a **mobile onboarding prototype** using Figma, reflected in the attached screenshots:

1. **Q1 – Social Connection:** “How often do you meet friends outside class?”
2. **Q6 – Emotional Status:** “I tend to overthink how others perceive me.”
3. **Q10 – Active Lifestyle:** “How often do you participate in group activities (e.g. sports, volunteering, clubs)?”
4. **Q15 – Digital Lifestyle:** “I prefer texting over face-to-face conversations.”

**Visual Enhancements:**

- Heart + orbit animation symbolizes AImee’s “connection through love (愛)” concept.
- Gradient progress bar shows onboarding completion (gamified journey).
- Category tags guide user awareness of wellness domains (“Active Lifestyle,” “Emotional Status”).
- 4-choice design simplifies response fatigue and aligns with mobile ergonomics.

### ☄️ **Stage 4 — Integration with AImee Algorithm**

AI suggested a **weighted Social Wellness Index (SWI)**:  
| Category | Weight |  
|:--|:--:|  
| Social Connection | 25% |  
| Emotional Confidence | 20% |  
| Active Lifestyle | 15% |  
| Digital Lifestyle | 15% |  
| Stress Coping | 15% |  
| Purpose & Engagement | 10% |

This index now determines users’ **initial starting level** in the AImee universe (Cosmic Dust → Galaxy) and serves as the foundation for AI-based matchmaking and personalized event recommendations.

## 💬 **Prompt**

> Hello GPT! let me provide you the updated information regarding our solution AImee. So basically, we are going to develop an app which fosters social wellness and community-based activity through ranking and level up system, by using AI to match between people of similar interest, location and level of activities. Our initial targeting group is young adults (university students) in Hong Kong, who are looking for opportunities to interact and get engaged in social events to improve their social wellness and alleviate the feeling of social isolation.
>
> (User journey summarized: onboarding → survey → initial level → event participation → points → level-up → feedback loop.)
>
> Now, based on this information:
>
> 1. Can you determine how many “levels” would be suitable?
> 2. Suggest a more unique, visually expressive concept (instead of “seed → sprout → plant”).
> 3. Justify the number of levels and explain the logic behind the progression system.
>
> (_Later note:_ Based on your suggestions, we have decided to stick with **6 levels** and designed icons: Cosmic Dust, Meteor, Moon, Planet, Stardust, and Galaxy. Please include how the project evolved.)

## AI Response Summary

### 🌌 **Finalized Cosmic Level System**

GPT-5 proposed a **cosmic progression model**, symbolizing growth from small individual presence to collective social influence — mirroring how one’s _social wellness_ expands from self-awareness to community impact.  
The concept balances **visual appeal**, **psychological reward structure**, and **ease of recognition** for app users.

|  Level   | Name              | Symbolism                                      | Represents                                                |
| :------: | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lv.1** | 🌫 **Cosmic Dust** | Small beginnings, potential waiting to connect | Users just starting their social journey                  |
| **Lv.2** | ☄️ **Meteor**     | Spark of motion and curiosity                  | Taking first steps toward interaction                     |
| **Lv.3** | 🌙 **Moon**       | Stability through recurring orbits             | Forming consistent social relationships                   |
| **Lv.4** | 🪐 **Planet**     | Independent ecosystem                          | Building a stable group or community presence             |
| **Lv.5** | ✨ **Stardust**   | Collective radiance and influence              | Inspiring others, sharing positive energy                 |
| **Lv.6** | 🌌 **Galaxy**     | Infinite connection and gravity                | Becoming a connector and role model in community wellness |

## Design Justification

### 1️⃣ **Why Six Levels**

- **Optimal engagement curve:** Six milestones offer visible progress without fatigue (ideal for semester-length challenges).
- **Psychological pacing:** Early levels are easy for motivation; later ones require consistency, reflecting real social habit-building.
- **Visual clarity:** Six unique cosmic forms are simple to illustrate and intuitive for users to remember.
- **Narrative cohesion:** Represents “expanding universes of connection,” aligning with AImee’s _AI + 愛 (Love Yourself)_ theme.

### 2️⃣ **Level Narrative Flow**

Each stage reflects personal growth within a community ecosystem:

1. **Cosmic Dust → Meteor:** From isolation to first contact.
2. **Meteor → Moon:** From curiosity to commitment.
3. **Moon → Planet:** Building reliability and group belonging.
4. **Planet → Stardust:** Becoming a positive influence in networks.
5. **Stardust → Galaxy:** Radiating collective social wellness.

This cosmic metaphor enables **gamified empathy** — users visualize their social evolution as something beautiful and vast.

## 3️⃣ **Quantitative Level Design**

To reinforce behavioral motivation, GPT-5 proposed a **1.4× exponential progression curve** for leveling difficulty — inspired by game design balance models (similar to Duolingo or Habitica).

| From → To | Points Required | Rationale                                   |
| :-------- | --------------: | :------------------------------------------ |
| L1 → L2   |     **600 pts** | Early accessibility; 2–3 small group events |
| L2 → L3   |     **850 pts** | Sustained engagement begins                 |
| L3 → L4   |   **1,200 pts** | Building consistent activity routine        |
| L4 → L5   |   **1,700 pts** | Rewarding active contribution               |
| L5 → L6   |   **2,400 pts** | Long-term mastery; leadership milestone     |

Total ≈ **6,750 points**, representing **25–30 social events per semester**, balanced for Hong Kong’s academic pace.

## 4️⃣ **Psychological & Cultural Rationale**

| Element                    | Meaning                                          | Reason for Fit                                   |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Cosmic imagery**         | Symbol of connectivity, expansion, and belonging | Universally positive metaphor across cultures    |
| **Progressive glow/scale** | Emotional feedback and sense of growth           | Reinforces intrinsic motivation                  |
| **Color gradient**         | Cool → warm hues                                 | Represents warmth from connection and confidence |
| **Non-competitive tone**   | Focused on _self-growth_, not rivalry            | Prevents stress in achievement-driven HK culture |

## Project Evolution

### 🪐 **Before AI Collaboration**

- Original idea used _plant growth_ (seed → sprout → plant).
- Concept lacked differentiation from other gamified health apps.
- No clear narrative link between level naming and AImee’s brand identity.
- Level progression numbers were arbitrary (500–1000 pts without logic).

### ✨ **After GPT-5 Collaboration**

- Adopted a **6-level cosmic system**, symbolically tied to AImee’s goal of “expanding social universes.”
- Introduced **mathematical justification** for point progression (1.4× curve).
- Established **clear role mapping** per level (beginner → community leader).
- Created **visual coherence** for branding and storytelling:  
  `Cosmic Dust → Meteor → Moon → Planet → Stardust → Galaxy`.
- Aligned with AImee’s tone — calm, uplifting, non-competitive.
