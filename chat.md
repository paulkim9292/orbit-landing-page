## 💬 Prompt

> “These are some sample on-board questionnaires that I came up with for our app. Based on this, can you create a longer set of questions? Also, I just randomly put it but it will be nice if you could categorize questions, for example: mental health, physical activity, social circle, self-esteem etc. These are just example categories so if you could think of better ones to assess social wellness in various aspects, please suggest me accordingly!”

**AI Response Summary:**  
GPT-5 proposed a six-category framework that captures social wellness comprehensively but in a non-clinical, youth-friendly tone.

#### 🧩 **Six Core Categories**

1. **Social Connection & Interaction** — Frequency and quality of in-person socializing.
2. **Emotional Confidence & Self-Esteem** — Self-perception in social and emotional contexts.
3. **Active Lifestyle & Participation** — Involvement in group or outdoor activities.
4. **Digital Lifestyle & Dependency** — Balance between online and offline socialization.
5. **Stress Coping & Emotional Sharing** — Willingness to communicate when under stress.
6. **Purpose & Community Engagement** — Motivation to participate in collective or altruistic causes.

Each category contained 3–5 multiple-choice questions with simple 4-point Likert answers. GPT-5 also suggested maintaining **short, conversational question phrasing** (“I tend to overthink how others perceive me”) and **emotionally neutral wording** to avoid judgment bias.

## Project Evolution

### 🪐 **Stage 1 — Initial State**

The first version of the questionnaire (pre-AI) was a simple static form with a few general lifestyle and emotional questions.  
It lacked visual identity, question hierarchy, and connection to AImee’s core theme of _social wellness gamification_.

### 🌙 **Stage 2 — After AI Integration**

After GPT-5’s guidance, the team implemented:

- A **6-dimension social wellness structure** based on behavioral psychology and digital wellbeing models.
- Refined Likert-scale phrasing with consistent answer progression (“Never → Sometimes → Often → Always”).
- Thematic labels for each category (e.g., _Emotional Status_, _Social Connection_, _Digital Lifestyle_).
- Personalized feedback logic: users’ answers feed into a “Social Wellness Index” determining their initial level (Cosmic Dust → Galaxy).

### 🌌 **Stage 3 — Visual Implementation**

Following the AI framework, the team designed a **mobile onboarding prototype** using Figma, reflected in the attached screenshots:

1. **Q1 – Social Connection:** “How often do you meet friends outside class?”
2. **Q6 – Emotional Status:** “I tend to overthink how others perceive me.”
3. **Q10 – Active Lifestyle:** “How often do you participate in group activities (e.g. sports, volunteering, clubs)?”
4. **Q15 – Digital Lifestyle:** “I prefer texting over face-to-face conversations.”

**Visual Enhancements:**

- Heart + orbit animation symbolizes AImee’s “connection through love (愛)” concept.
- Gradient progress bar shows onboarding completion (gamified journey).
- Category tags guide user awareness of wellness domains (“Active Lifestyle,” “Emotional Status”).
- 4-choice design simplifies response fatigue and aligns with mobile ergonomics.

### ☄️ **Stage 4 — Integration with AImee Algorithm**

AI suggested a **weighted Social Wellness Index (SWI)**:  
| Category | Weight |  
|:--|:--:|  
| Social Connection | 25% |  
| Emotional Confidence | 20% |  
| Active Lifestyle | 15% |  
| Digital Lifestyle | 15% |  
| Stress Coping | 15% |  
| Purpose & Engagement | 10% |

This index now determines users’ **initial starting level** in the AImee universe (Cosmic Dust → Galaxy) and serves as the foundation for AI-based matchmaking and personalized event recommendations.

## 3️⃣ **Quantitative Level Design**

To reinforce behavioral motivation, GPT-5 proposed a **1.4× exponential progression curve** for leveling difficulty — inspired by game design balance models (similar to Duolingo or Habitica).

| From → To | Points Required | Rationale                                   |
| :-------- | --------------: | :------------------------------------------ |
| L1 → L2   |     **600 pts** | Early accessibility; 2–3 small group events |
| L2 → L3   |     **850 pts** | Sustained engagement begins                 |
| L3 → L4   |   **1,200 pts** | Building consistent activity routine        |
| L4 → L5   |   **1,700 pts** | Rewarding active contribution               |
| L5 → L6   |   **2,400 pts** | Long-term mastery; leadership milestone     |

Total ≈ **6,750 points**, representing **25–30 social events per semester**, balanced for Hong Kong’s academic pace.

## Project Evolution

### 🪐 **Before AI Collaboration**

- Original idea used _plant growth_ (seed → sprout → plant).
- Concept lacked differentiation from other gamified health apps.
- No clear narrative link between level naming and AImee’s brand identity.
- Level progression numbers were arbitrary (500–1000 pts without logic).

### ✨ **After GPT-5 Collaboration**

- Adopted a **6-level cosmic system**, symbolically tied to AImee’s goal of “expanding social universes.”
- Introduced **mathematical justification** for point progression (1.4× curve).
- Established **clear role mapping** per level (beginner → community leader).
- Created **visual coherence** for branding and storytelling:  
  `Cosmic Dust → Meteor → Moon → Planet → Stardust → Galaxy`.
- Aligned with AImee’s tone — calm, uplifting, non-competitive.
