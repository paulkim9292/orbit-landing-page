## Overview

Orbit is an interactive presentation website introducing **AImee** (愛 + AI), a social wellness application designed to combat social isolation among Hong Kong university students aged 18-23. The project addresses a critical mental health crisis, where 51.9% of young adults exhibit depression and anxiety symptoms, and 85% report having no one to turn to for emotional support.

## The Problem

Hong Kong's achievement-driven culture, combined with smartphone addiction (98% penetration rate—world's highest) and superficial social connections, has created an epidemic of social isolation. The "hidden youth" phenomenon has grown significantly, with over 5,500 students regularly skipping classes due to social anxiety and disconnection. Traditional approaches have failed to address the root causes: competitive pressure, digital dependency, and lack of genuine personal connection.

## The Solution

AImee employs a gamified approach to encourage authentic social engagement through real-world events. Users complete a comprehensive 20-question wellness survey across four dimensions (Social Connection, Emotional Status, Active Lifestyle, Digital Lifestyle) and progress through six cosmic levels—from Cosmic Dust to Galaxy—by participating in community activities. The system is intentionally non-competitive and inspirational, using a cosmic metaphor to represent expanding social universes rather than individual rankings.

## Technology

The presentation is built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring:

- 13-page interactive scroll-based storytelling
- Advanced animation system with position interpolation and cubic easing
- Dynamic data visualizations (SVG charts, counters)
- Intersection Observer API for performance-optimized viewport animations
- Responsive design with custom CSS properties
